## Description

For this assignment, I had to write 2 programs using python. First, I created a calculator to determine the sum of powers (b**1+b**2+...b**n) using a while loop. Second, I had to calculate the temperature of tea every minute as it cools to room temperature. I also used a while loop for this exercise.

## What I Learned from This

From this exercise, I learned how to use while loops when creating codes.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.
